A language translator using the MarianMT model leverages Neural Machine Translation (NMT) to translate text between languages. MarianMT, an efficient and lightweight NMT framework, is built on PyTorch and optimized for scalability and speed. It uses a sequence-to-sequence architecture with attention mechanisms, enabling accurate and fluent translations. With pretrained models available for a wide range of language pairs, MarianMT makes it easy to implement and deploy translation systems for diverse use cases, from real-time communication to content localization. Its open-source nature allows customization and fine-tuning for domain-specific applications.
